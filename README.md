This gem contains the [zoom.us](https://zoom.us/) strategy for OmniAuth.

## Before You Begin

You should have already installed OmniAuth into your app; if not, read the [OmniAuth README](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) to get started.

Now sign into the [zoom App Marketplace](https://marketplace.zoom.us/docs/guides) and create an application. Take note of your API keys.

## Using This Strategy

First start by adding this gem to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-zoom'
```

If you need to use the latest HEAD version, you can do so with:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-zoom', :github => 'koshilife/omniauth-zoom'
```

Next, tell OmniAuth about this provider. For a Rails app, your `config/initializers/omniauth.rb` file should look like this:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  zoom_scopes = %i[user_profile meeting:write]
  provider :zoom, zoom_client_id, zoom_client_secret, :scope => zoom_scopes.join(',')
end
```

Replace `"API_KEY"` and `"API_SECRET"` with the appropriate values you obtained [earlier](https://marketplace.zoom.us/user/build).

## Auth Hash Example

The auth hash `request.env['omniauth.auth']` would look like this:

```js
{
  "provider": "zoom",
  "uid": "KdYKjnimT4KPd8FFgQt9FQ",
  "info": {},
  "credentials": {
    "token": "ACCESS_TOKEN",

    "expires_at": 1594035991,
    "expires": true
  },

    }
  }
}
```

## Refreshing an Access Token

Access token expires after one hour, therefore you will have to [refresh a user's access token](git@github.com:koshilife/omniauth-zoom.git) when they expire.

Encode the Client ID and Client Secret with [Base64](https://www.base64encode.org/) for the "Basic" authorization string in your request header.

```ruby
require 'faraday'

CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>'
CLIENT_SECRET = '<YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET>'
REFRESH_TOKEN = '<YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN>'

headers_secret = Base64.strict_encode64("#{CLIENT_ID}:#{CLIENT_SECRET}")
headers = { 'Authorization': "Basic #{headers_secret}" }

params = { grant_type: 'refresh_token', refresh_token: REFRESH_TOKEN}
url = "https://zoom.us/oauth/token?#{params.to_query}"
res = Faraday.post url do |req|
  req.headers = headers
end
raise 'zoom api error' unless res.status == 200

body = JSON.parse(res.body, symbolize_names: true)
new_access_token = body[:access_token]
new_refresh_token = body[:refresh_token]
access_token_expires_at = Time.current.since(body[:expires_in])
```

If successful, it will respond with something like this:

```json
{
    "access_token": "NEW ACCESS TOKEN",
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "refresh_token": "NEW REFRESH TOKEN",
    "expires_in": 3599,
    "scope": "user:read"
}
```
